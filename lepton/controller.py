"""Particle controllers

particle controllers are bound to particle groups and invoked
via the group's update() method. A controller is a callable
object that accepts a timedelta and group as its argument.

A typical controller will iterate all particles in a group,
apply some logic and mutate the particles or remove or add
particles to the group.
