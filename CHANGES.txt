2009-4-23 -- 0.10a

- Add Drag controller to simulate viscous drag (i.e., wind, water)
- Add vortex example to show off drag controller
- Improve numeric stability of Magnet controller (changes charge value scale)
- Replace inner_cutoff parameter of magnet controller with variable epsilon
- Implement SpriteTexturizer, refactor examples to use it
- Add letters example to show off texture atlas support
- Add texture support to PointRenderer via point sprites
- Add create_point_texture() function for generating blended
  point textures. Refactor fire, smoke, and other examples to use them.
- Implement FlipBookTexturizer for particle texture animation
- Add animated logo example to show off FlipBookTexturizer
- ParticleGroup.new() now accepts keyword args for particle attributes.
- Add generate example

2009-3-15 -- 0.9a

- Fix reference leaks in particle emission and domain generate methods
- Plane domains are now proper half-space geometries so they support 
  __contains__, which means they can be used with the Collector controller.
- Implement Point domain.
- Implement arbitrarily orientable Disc, Cylinder and Cone domains.
- Add tunnel example.
- Implement new closest_point_to() methods for various domains.
- Fix distribution of points generated in a Sphere domain with a nonzero
  inner radius.
- Refactor renderer/group binding to avoid circrefs and an infinite loop
  bug. This also simplifies the API. Thanks to Ken Lauer for the report.
- Fix color bug in the billboard renderer, thanks again to Ken Lauer.
- Add ParticleSystem.run_ahead() method to warm up the particle system
  or "fast forward" the simulation.
- Add Magnet controller and example. Thanks to Andrew Charles for the
  initial implementation of these.
- Various code cleanups and fixes for building on Windows. Thanks to
  Jussi Lepistö.

2009-1-28 -- 0.8.1a

- Adjusted code so it compiles with Visual C++ 2008.
  Big thanks to Jussi Lepistö (Knarkles) for doing this work!
- Use PyOS_snprintf instead of snprintf for better portability.

2009-1-7 -- 0.8a

- Fixed accuracy of bounce controller so that particles are much less likely
  to escape from a container domain. (Thanks to dugres for reporting the bug)
- Fixed bug in Sphere.intersect() where it would return bogus vectors such
  as (nan,nan,nan) for stationary particles in some instances. This allowed
  an improvement to the bouncy example to further prevent errant particles.
- Collector controller ported to C
- Bounce controller ported to C
- Add 2D splode example to demonstrate how to use lepton with the default
  pyglet OpenGL projection.
- Allow basic attribute access for the C controllers from Python
  (More work is needed here for more complex attributes, like vectors)

2008-12-28 -- 0.7a

- Fader controller ported to C
- Added per-particle emitter and fireworks example
- Port Line and Plane domains to C
- Port Box domain to C, rename to AABox. deprecate domain.Box for reuse later
- Port Sphere domain to C, add support for inner and outer radius for
  spherical shells
- Bounce controller gets separate bounce and friction parameters
- Improve lame pygame fill example to use new bounce features and be less lame
  (2.5D, suhweet!)
- Implement particle proxy and vector object pools to reduce or eliminate
  object allocation when iterating and traversing particles from python
- Optimize particle group C typecheck function

2008-08-17 -- 0.6a

- Remove inline redefinition cruft that was causing problems building on
  win32 (Thanks to Fabrice Capiez for help debugging)
- Add pygame bubbles demo to show off the pygame blit renderer
- Fix some bugs in the blit renderer
- Add a surface cache to the blit renderer to improve performance when
  rotation and scaling are enabled.

2008-08-16 -- 0.5a

- (Hopefully) Fix "initializer element is not constant" error compiling 
  on Windows with Python binary release
- Fix bug building on Mac with Python Binary release (issue #1)
- Add particle growth controller
- Add explosion example
- Add clamp() method to particle vectors
- Add simple pygame fill example

2008-08-11 -- 0.4a

- Fix setup.py to support cygwin on windows (Still need to work on VC)
- Implement rotation in billboard renderer
- Allow dynamic modifications of emitter template and deviation
- Add pygame renderers
- Fix some renderer bugs on win32
- Add flyby example
- Add WIP bonk example game

2008-08-06 -- 0.3a (pre)release

- Fix crash-bug in StaticEmitter_dealloc(), thanks to Drew Perttula

2008-08-06 -- 0.2a (pre)release

- Spruce up the setup.py to add include and library dirs for particular oses
- Fix imports in examples and clean up a little
- Add boring license headers

2008-08-06 -- 0.1a (pre)release

- Throw it over the wall...duck!
