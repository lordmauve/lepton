2008-1-28 -- 0.8.1a

- Adjusted code so it compiles with Visual C++ 2008.
  Big thanks to Jussi Lepist√∂ (Knarkles) for doing this work!
- Use PyOS_snprintf instead of snprintf for better portability.

2009-1-7 -- 0.8a

- Fixed accuracy of bounce controller so that particles are much less likely
  to escape from a container domain. (Thanks to dugres for reporting the bug)
- Fixed bug in Sphere.intersect() where it would return bogus vectors such
  as (nan,nan,nan) for stationary particles in some instances. This allowed
  an improvement to the bouncy example to further prevent errant particles.
- Collector controller ported to C
- Bounce controller ported to C
- Add 2D splode example to demonstrate how to use lepton with the default
  pyglet OpenGL projection.
- Allow basic attribute access for the C controllers from Python
  (More work is needed here for more complex attributes, like vectors)

2008-12-28 -- 0.7a

- Fader controller ported to C
- Added per-particle emitter and fireworks example
- Port Line and Plane domains to C
- Port Box domain to C, rename to AABox. deprecate domain.Box for reuse later
- Port Sphere domain to C, add support for inner and outer radius for
  spherical shells
- Bounce controller gets separate bounce and friction parameters
- Improve lame pygame fill example to use new bounce features and be less lame
  (2.5D, suhweet!)
- Implement particle proxy and vector object pools to reduce or eliminate
  object allocation when iterating and traversing particles from python
- Optimize particle group C typecheck function

2008-08-17 -- 0.6a

- Remove inline redefinition cruft that was causing problems building on
  win32 (Thanks to Fabrice Capiez for help debugging)
- Add pygame bubbles demo to show off the pygame blit renderer
- Fix some bugs in the blit renderer
- Add a surface cache to the blit renderer to improve performance when
  rotation and scaling are enabled.

2008-08-16 -- 0.5a

- (Hopefully) Fix "initializer element is not constant" error compiling 
  on Windows with Python binary release
- Fix bug building on Mac with Python Binary release (issue #1)
- Add particle growth controller
- Add explosion example
- Add clamp() method to particle vectors
- Add simple pygame fill example

2008-08-11 -- 0.4a

- Fix setup.py to support cygwin on windows (Still need to work on VC)
- Implement rotation in billboard renderer
- Allow dynamic modifications of emitter template and deviation
- Add pygame renderers
- Fix some renderer bugs on win32
- Add flyby example
- Add WIP bonk example game

2008-08-06 -- 0.3a (pre)release

- Fix crash-bug in StaticEmitter_dealloc(), thanks to Drew Perttula

2008-08-06 -- 0.2a (pre)release

- Spruce up the setup.py to add include and library dirs for particular oses
- Fix imports in examples and clean up a little
- Add boring license headers

2008-08-06 -- 0.1a (pre)release

- Throw it over the wall...duck!
